# What it does
Go-StatusMonitor checks a list of servers and outputs the status in to a MySQL table.<br>
If any servers are down it will send a email alerting you that servers are down!<br>
It out puts into a MySQL table so you could display the status of servers in tools like Grafana.<br>
<br><br>
# How do I setup the MySQL table?
It's simple just make a new Table a bit like this:<br>
```sql
CREATE TABLE GoStatusMonitor (
Server_Name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
Status VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
);
```
